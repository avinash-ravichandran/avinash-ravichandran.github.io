I'm a machine learning scientist and systems architect working at the intersection of cutting-edge AI research and real-world deployment. Currently, I serve as Chief Architect of Machine Learning at SambaNova Systems, where I lead efforts in multimodal AI—for differentiating our hardware.

Before this, I was a Principal Scientist at Cruise, focused on bringing foundational models into AV perception systems, and spent nearly a decade at Amazon, where I helped launch large-scale ML products like AWS Rekognition Custom Labels. I earned my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Johns Hopkins University under [Dr. René Vidal](https://www.cis.jhu.edu/~rvidal/) and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at UCLA with [Dr. Stefano Soatto](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~soatto/).

My research interests include multimodal vision-language models, generative AI (diffusion models), few-shot and continual learning, and scalable machine learning systems that bridge foundational research and production impact.
