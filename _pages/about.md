I am currently a Principal Scientist at AWS. I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at the [Vision Lab at UCLA](http://vision.ucla.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Stefano Soatto](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~soatto/) and obtained my PhD in fall 2010 from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of Dr. Ren√© Vidal. My research interests include machine learning and computer vision. More specifically, I am interested in exploring few-shot learning, transfer learning, meta-learning and related problems.



How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
