I am currently a Principal Scientist at Cruise. Prior to cruise I spent nearly a decade at Amazon in differnt groups such as Firephone, Visual Search and AWS AI Labls (CV Science). I completed my postdoctoral fellowship in Fall 2013 at the [Vision Lab at UCLA](http://vision.ucla.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Stefano Soatto](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~soatto/) and obtained my PhD in fall 2010 from the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of [Dr. Ren√© Vidal](http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~rvidal/). My research interests include machine learning and computer vision. More specifically, I am interested in exploring few-shot learning, transfer learning, meta-learning and related problems.
